                fee. If the cancellation happens post the booking start time,
                then the entire booking fee will be charged as cancellation fee.

      <h1 style="text-align: left; color: green">Member's Responsibility</h1>
      <p style="color: black; font-weight: 500">
        If a Zoomcar member is violating the law or Zoomcar rules, for example
        by overspeeding or driving drunk, the member will be responsible for all
        damage, liability, and fines and could face legal action.
      </p>
      <h2>Responsibility for Payment:</h2>
      <p>
        Payments by Members shall be made with his/her credit card or debit
        card. The Member is under obligation to ensure that the account from
        which the amounts are to be collected have sufficient funds or credit
        available to cover any charges. Member is solely responsible for any
        associated bank or credit card charges or fees. Member may be charged a
        processing fee for a declined credit or debit card payment. In the event
        the Member defaults on any payments, Zoomcar is entitled to charge
        reminder fees and default interest in accordance with the provisions of
        the law. In addition, Zoomcar may utilize third parties to collect
        amounts owed to Zoomcar by a Member. With all fees mentioned above,
        Zoomcar reserves the right to prohibit a Member from making a subsequent
        reservation until all outstanding fees in the Member's account have been
        paid in full. In the event a fee is incurred, Members will receive an
        email invoice from Zoomcar that will have detailed payment instructions
      </p>
      <h2>Collision or other incident:</h2>
      <p>
        Zoomcar provides full wrap unlimited third party liability insurance
        without a maximum cap. If member is involved in an unintentional/non
        consequential incident/accident (including but not limited to a
        collision or misuse of the vehicle) Member will be responsible for a
        standard insurance deductible payment of up to ₹ 10,000. The Member will
        be obligated to pay the repair cost up to ₹ 10000. The payment owed will
        be deducted from the security deposit, if any. Should the security
        deposit not cover the payment (in the case the Member has accrued late
        return, excess km, etc charges) the balance of the payment owed shall be
        payable by the Member separately as an additional outstanding.
      </p>
      <h2>Tolls:</h2>
      <p>
        By joining Zoomcar, the Member agrees to pay Zoomcar the costs, charges,
        fees and expenses set out in the Agreement, including specifically and
        without limitation those set forth in this schedule. The following is
        not exhaustive and other specific fees, costs and charges may apply.
        Other applicable costs will be communicated to the Member. Capitalized
        terms used in this schedule shall have the same meaning assigned to such
        terms in the Agreement. Zoomcar reserves the right to change the terms
        of this Policy from time to time and shall give notice of such changes
        to the Member in a timely manner. Notice to the Members shall be
        considered given when such notice is indicated and accessible from the
        first page accessed after the Member log-on to the Zoomcar website, or
        by email to the Member's email address provided to Zoomcar in the
        Member's application or most recently provided to Zoomcar. Member agrees
        that the amended terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be
        effective and binding the earlier of (1) the effective date indicated in
